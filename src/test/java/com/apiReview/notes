API: Application Programs Interface - Middleman

API : Business Layer

the companies control their database with their API
like who will access and what data they can access

API is also called in some case: Web Services, google map, weather, news,
Zip Web Service  API

WebApp+MobileApp  ---- API -----Backend(DataBase+Data Source)

Request AND Response

Postman for manually test APIs, but postman can be used in an automated way

We use RestAssured Library to automate API testing

Request : What do we need? End Point = URL + path parameters
is query parameter part of the URL? NO
        * We need Headers: content type+auoth
        * POST,PUT and PATCH request (you might need body)

Understanding API Documentation will get you the JOB (Swagger Document)

RESPONSE: We verify headers, status code and body
verifying body : 6 approach
        - String method
        - path
        - jsonPath
        - hemcrest matchers
        De-serialization : Which method we call?  as() method
        - json to Java Collection
        - json to POJO(Plain Old Java Object)
         We need Object Mappers(Data Binders): Jackson, Gson Dependency
         - We will mostly use this for GET requests

       Serialization (JAVA to JSON) : we use body() method
       - POST, PUT, PATCH

    ** Path and JsonPath are using Gpath Syntax

       Strange Vocabulary With API testing:
       Lombok, JSON, JACKSON, GSON, POJO, GPATH, JAMAL, HEMCREST

       How to choose which way to use?
       - Only one data: String Manipulation (contains method)
       - One time job, not a big project, more than one data: Collection, hemcrest, path or jsonPath
       - At your companies: You need to spend time to create POJO Casses
                - Takes time but very useful and maintainable
